With all 3 constraints:
The program chose 24 polygons.
Their total carbon storage was approx. 1857, compared to an overall carbon storage of 5605.5
The optimial solution saw the total cost of 67793 compared to the budget of 140963
with an area of 2043 out of 8054

With just constraint 1 and 2:
The program chose 24 polygons
Their total carbon storage was approx. 1865, compared to an overall carbon storage of 5605.5
The optimial solution saw the total cost of 63218 compared to the budget of 140963
With an area of 2005 out of 8054

When the polygons can be adjacent (only constraint 1):
The program chose 61 polygons.
Their total carbon storage was approx. 4350.8, compared to an overall carbon storage of 5605.5
The optimial solution saw the total cost of 140757 compared to the budget of 140963



Interestingly, the optimal subsets were almost equal in both cases including and not including constraint #3.
This is probably because constraint #3 bounds their area from below, and the optimal solution already has high area.
It would be also be interesting to modfiy constraint #3 to bound their total area from above to conserve space, rather than below.

Another observation is that I filtered out 0 polygons (since all of them had area at least 37 km^2).

Furthermore, I was suprised by how little you can maximize the carbon when applying constraint 2.

There is also a bug (probably from PULP) when setting a constraint that the polygon area must be >= 3/4 of the total area.
Since there are no possible subsets in that case, then it ignores the adjacency constraint.
